A simple and limited GDB wrapper in Java.

Most of the functionalities are commented inside the .java files. As far as I remember it works with BufferedReader/Writer to make gdb calls from the terminal. I also made a hardcoded and an interactive version.

Thanks for checking it out... I'll hopefully have some more interesting repos soon.
