# Jebugger
Test task for the "C and C++ Debuggers Integration" application

Hello! All of the files should be available in SDBuggerFinal including gradle.build, all of the Java files and of course the sum.c file that will be debugged by the program.
The functionalities of the classes have been commented out in the code.
Since the project doesn't have any remarkable dependencies and such, the only thing I'll mention here is the compile task in the gradle.build file, which compiles the sum.c into sum.exe when the project is built.
